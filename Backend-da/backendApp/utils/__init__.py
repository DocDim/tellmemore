# --- File: backendApp/utils/__init__.py ---
# This file makes the 'utils' directory a Python package.
# It can contain general utility functions.

# # Example: You could move get_db here if preferred, but it's often kept with app.py
# # from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
# # from contextlib import contextmanager

# # @contextmanager
# # def get_db_session(SessionLocal):
# #     db = SessionLocal()
# #     try:
# #         yield db
# #     finally:
# #         db.close()
